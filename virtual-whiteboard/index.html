                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Inspiration:</strong> The idea for this project 
                                            came to me while I was on a video call. I was trying to 
                                            explain how to do a Fourier transform to a friend and I 
                                            tried to use a dry erase whiteboard to show them how I solved it.
                                            I quickly realized that the glare was too much and my writing was
                                            to small to be visible on the camera. I decided this would be a fun solution.
                                            This was also vaguely inspired from a video I remember seeing
                                            when I was young about Pranav Mistry's SixthSense.

                                        <p>
                                            <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python (OpenCV, Mediapipe, numpy)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This program utilizes your device's camera to mimic 
                                            a digital whiteboard. When running, the user can fully 
                                            control the program thru their device's camera by putting 
                                            their hands in view of the camera and making certain gestures.
                                            For optimal hand detection, when trying to perform a gesture, 
                                            try to have your entire hand in frame with your palm directly 
                                            facing the camera. Performance is limited by your device's performance 
                                            because this program runs frame by frame. As a result, lines 
                                            may not appear continuous if you move your hands too fast. 
                                            For optimal results, move your hand slowly to match your device's FPS.

                                <h3>Features</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Hand Movement/Position Tracking</strong> - Utilizing Mediapipe and OpenCV, I was able to
                                            use the user's device's camera to track the user's hands. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Draw</strong> - When the user touches their thumb and pointer fingers, 
                                            the thumb landmark will turn blue. The thumb landmark will then leave a blue dot
                                            wherever it does.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Erase</strong> - When the user touches their thumb and pinky fingers,
                                            the thumb landmark will turn green and a countdown will begin. If the countdown
                                            reaches zero, all drawn dots will be erased.
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Exit</strong> - When the user touches their thumb and ring fingers,
                                            the thumb landmark will turn red and a countdown will begin. If the countdown
                                            reaches zero, the program will close.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </p>
                                <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                                <p>
                                    I decided to make the thumb the center of all functionality
                                    because every other finger easily accessible to it.  
                                    Thumb and the pointer finger have to be closer together to 
                                    trigger the Draw functionalty than the thumb/pinky or thumb/ring finger
                                    have to be to trigger the Exit or Erase functionality. This 
                                    was done on purpose to prevent any accidental drawing. The
                                    Erase and Exit features are triggered by a timer for this same
                                    reason, to prevent accidental erasing or exitting.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Possible Future Updates</h3>
                                <p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Undo</strong> - Undo the previous draw</li>
                                        <li><strong>Change Draw Color</strong> - Change the color for future drawing</li>
                                        <li><strong>Change Draw Radius</strong> - Change the radius of future dots drawn</li>
                                    </ul>
